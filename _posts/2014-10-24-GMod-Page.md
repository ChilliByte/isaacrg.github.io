description: A generic loading page for Garry's Mod servers.
---

I have developed a fast and easy to use loading page for Garry's Mod servers. While ironing out difficulties with the system may take some time, this page is already hosted, via Github Pages, and it takes advantage of Jekyll v2.x.x's new Coffeescript compilation capactity. This may well be useful for Server admins who wish for the downloaders of larger download packs to have an idea of what is going on. In the future, I may look at adding a customisation tool.

The website resides at [isaacrg.github.io/gmodpage/](http://isaacrg.github.io/gmodpage/), and is therefore available on Github at [isaacrg/gmodpage](https://github.com/isaacrg/gmodpage)
