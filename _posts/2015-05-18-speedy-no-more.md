I'm not going to lie. I always have more than enough tabs open.

This has never been much of a problem for me, using [Google Chrome][google-chrome] since release, and I used [Opera][opera] sporadically. Google Chrome had served me well, for some time, with its original aim of simply being the fastest, nicest, easiest-to-use browser out there going well. Until Chrome began to get hungry.

For some time now, Chrome has grown a reputation for being a heavy consumer of RAM. It is no longer considered fastest browser, and a number of other browsers are arguably just as fast, if not, faster. Firefox is not the slow browser is gained its reputation as, Opera is arguably more user-friendly and as chrome now, and there are many other good browsers out there.

But the reason I come to writing this, is because I have met a point of great frustration. This happened.
